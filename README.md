## Project Description

In this project, data containing information about medical appointments in Brazil will be explored. The dataset includes 110,527 medical appointments and their associated attributes. The most important attribute and our focus is the No Show Status which indicates if a patient showed up for the scheduled appointment or not. I want to answer the following questions:
* Does the time differences between the days the appointments were made and the appointment dates correlate with the number of appointments that were missed?
* Which age group has the highest attendance rate?
